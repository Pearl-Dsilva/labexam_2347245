Scenario 2: Building an Educational Blog Platform
You have been given the task of developing an educational blog platform named "LearnWell"
that aims to provide insightful articles on various topics. The platform needs to have a clean
and user-friendly interface, utilizing HTML features, CSS components, and Bootstrap
components effectively.
Question:
Your goal is to design the front-end of the "LearnWell" educational blog platform. Provide a
comprehensive plan for incorporating HTML features, CSS components, and Bootstrap
components for different aspects of the website.
Header and Navigation: The top of the platform should include a logo, a search bar, categories
for articles, and a user login/register button. Detail which HTML elements, CSS styles, and
Bootstrap classes you would employ to create an engaging and responsive header.
Article Listings: The platform's homepage should display a list of recent articles, each
featuring a thumbnail image, title, brief excerpt, and a "Read More" button. Explain how you
would structure the HTML for the article listings, style them with CSS to ensure readability,
and possibly integrate Bootstrap components for consistent spacing.
Article Display: When a user clicks on an article, they should be taken to a page displaying
the full article content, author information, and a comment section. Describe how you would
design the HTML structure for an individual article page, apply CSS to enhance readability,
and potentially utilize Bootstrap elements to ensure responsiveness.
Sidebar Widgets: The sidebar should contain widgets displaying popular articles, recent
comments, and a subscription form. Outline how you would implement these widgets using
HTML, style them with CSS for visual appeal, and possibly utilize Bootstrap components to
organize the sidebar content effectively.
User Profile Page: Registered users should have a profile page displaying their avatar,
username, bio, and a list of articles they've contributed.
Footer and Contact Information: The bottom of the platform should include links to
important pages, a subscription form, and contact information. Specify which HTML elements,
CSS styles, and Bootstrap components you would use to create an informative and visually
consistent footer.
